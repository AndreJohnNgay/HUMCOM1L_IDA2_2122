                <p>Baguio, to many, is best known as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines", with its cool climate making this a spot to escape the chaotic scenes in Manila. The city is also home to tropical pine forests, lending the city the nickname "City of Pines". It serves as a tourist hub in the Cordilleras, serving as a jumping point to other tourist spots like Mount Pulag, Sagada and Banaue.</p>

                <p>Officially named the Dominican Hill Retreat House but popularly referred to as the Diplomat Hotel, the 17-hectare property is sprawled atop the Dominican Hill. It was originally built as a retreat house for the Dominican priests and nuns in the first half of the 20th century until World War II, when the Japanese took over and turned it into a military garrison and war prison.<br>After restorations and remodeling, the Diplomat Hotel was launched and operated between the 1970s and the 1980s. Given its history, especially the atrocities of WWII, it gained notoriety for paranormal activities, consistently putting it on the list of most haunted places in the Philippines.</p>

The tombstones were inscribed with witty and punny “eulogies” which may sometimes require a dash of sarcasm to understand.</p>
